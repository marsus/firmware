## v0.4.4

### FEATURES
 - logging output [documentation](docs/debugging.md)
 - pressing 'v' in SoftAP mode displays the system version. FIRM-128
 - P1: API (compatible with Core) to access the 1MByte external flash. [#498](https://github.com/spark/firmware/pull/498)
 - Arduino compatibility macros for PROGMEM and more.
 - `RGB.onChange` handler receives notification of the current LED color when it changes. Can be used to match an external LED to the onboard led. [#518](https://github.com/spark/firmware/pull/518) Thanks to @monkbroc!
 - Serial2 available on P1 and Photon (note: this also requires above RGB.onChange handler and two resistors would need to be removed on the Photon)
 - `Spark.connected()` et al. is now `Particle.connected()`. The former `Spark` library is still available but is deprecated.
 - `System.freeMemory()` API to determine the amount of available RAM.
 - `STARTUP()` macro to define blocks of code that execute at startup.

### ENHANCEMENTS
 - Retrieve the LED brightness via `RGB.brightness()`
 - More prominent color change on the RGB LED when there is a cloud connection error.

 - Improved I2C Master receive method and implemented error handler - [commit](https://github.com/spark/firmware/commit/1bc00ea480ef1fcdbd8ef9ba3df12b121183aeae) -  [commit](https://github.com/spark/firmware/commit/5359f19985756182ff6511217cbcb588b3341a87)
 - `WiFi.selectAntenna()` default antenna is now INTERNAL. Can be called at startup (before WiFi is initialized to select the desired antenna.

 - `WiFi.listen(false)` to programmatically exit WiFi listening mode.
 - make is verbose by default. To silence, add `-s` to the command line.
